      <p>I saw this types of posts (not blogs) while browsing <br>
        stumbleupon and must say this is very topic idea.<br>
        Collect less known or unknown , but usefull sites and<br>
        create a blog listing them. Your blog will get millions of <br>
        visitors just from Stumbleupon.com <br><br><br>

                     <h2> Wait, what?</h2>
    <p> Wait a minute, I said I want it simple, but not boring. What's up with this design? There's<br>
    nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture.That's not what I had in<br>
    mind.The type is all in Helvetica, which I like, but doesen't excite me at all.There is just no<br>
    character to anything here. It has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla. I really need<br>
    something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.<br>
